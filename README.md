# CYNTHIA-UGWU-WEBSITE-CLONE
I created a clone application for the Cynthia-Ugwu website (https://www.cynthiaugwu.com/), This clone is totally based on HTML, CSS and Javascript and a little bit of GSAP. I have also used the locomotive js for smooth scrolling and have tried to give my website a similar look and feel, as much as I can.
